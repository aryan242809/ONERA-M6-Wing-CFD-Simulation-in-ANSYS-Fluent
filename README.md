# ONERA-M6-Wing-CFD-Simulation-in-ANSYS-Fluent
This repository documents a high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of the ONERA M6 wing, a benchmark case widely used for validating aerodynamic solvers. The simulation was carried out in ANSYS Fluent, covering all phases from domain generation and meshing to solver setup, post-processing, grid convergence .
